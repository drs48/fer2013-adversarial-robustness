# Project: Adversarial Robustness on FER2013

## 1. What this project does

This project trains a convolutional neural network on the FER2013 facial expression dataset and then tests how the model behaves under adversarial attacks using PGD and DeepFool. It also trains a more robust model using adversarial training and evaluates a simple defense based on feature squeezing.

The main code is in the Jupyter notebook `fer2013-adversarial-robustness.ipynb`.

## 2. Requirements

Python version  
Python 3.8 or newer

Recommended hardware  
NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support  
At least 8 GB RAM

Python packages  
tensorflow 2.x  
numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
scikit-learn  
foolbox==3.3.4  

Example installation commands:

`pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`  
`pip install foolbox==3.3.4`

## 3. Dataset setup

Dataset used  
FER2013 facial expression dataset

Source  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishpatel26/facial-expression-recognitionferchallenge

### Local setup

Step 1  
Download `fer2013.csv` from the Kaggle dataset page.

Step 2  
Place `fer2013.csv` in a folder of your choice inside this project, for example in a folder called `data`:

`data/fer2013.csv`

Step 3  
Open `fer2013-adversarial-robustness.ipynb` in Jupyter or another notebook environment.

Step 4  
In the cell where `csv_path` is defined, update the path so it points to your local file. For example:

`csv_path = "data/fer2013.csv"`

Save the notebook after you change the path.

### Kaggle setup

If you run the notebook on Kaggle and attach the same FER2013 dataset to the notebook, you can keep the original `csv_path` that uses the `../input` path. In that case you do not need to change anything, as long as the dataset is correctly attached to the Kaggle notebook.

## 4. How to run the code

Step 1  
Activate the environment that has all required packages installed.

Step 2  
Start Jupyter (or open the notebook in Colab or Kaggle) and open `fer2013-adversarial-robustness.ipynb`.

Step 3  
Verify that the `csv_path` variable points to the correct location of `fer2013.csv` as described above.

Step 4  
Run all cells in order, from the first cell to the last one.

The notebook will then:

import libraries and set global options  
load and preprocess FER2013 from `fer2013.csv`  
build and train a baseline CNN model or load `baseline_cnn.h5` if it already exists  
evaluate the baseline model on clean test data  
generate adversarial examples using PGD and DeepFool  
evaluate the baseline model on adversarial examples  
apply feature squeezing with spatial smoothing and reevaluate  
run adversarial training with PGD and DeepFool and save the robust model as `robust_cnn_adv_pgd_df_pro.h5`  
load the robust model and evaluate it on clean and adversarial data  
validate the custom PGD and DeepFool implementations against the Foolbox implementations  

### Training notes

The first training of the baseline model and especially the adversarial training phase can take a long time on CPU. A GPU is strongly recommended. If the files `baseline_cnn.h5` or `robust_cnn_adv_pgd_df_pro.h5` already exist in the project directory, the notebook will load them and skip the corresponding training steps.

## 5. Outputs

After running the entire notebook you should have:

`baseline_cnn.h5`  
Model trained only on clean FER2013 images.

`robust_cnn_adv_pgd_df_pro.h5`  
Model trained with adversarial examples generated by PGD and DeepFool.

The notebook also prints test accuracy and loss for both clean and adversarial data and shows several plots that compare clean and adversarial images and summarize the training progress.
